# AI Study Organizer - Sprint Documentation

## Sprint 1: AI-Powered Features
- ✅ AI-powered text summarization with Google AI integration
- ✅ Comprehensive quiz generation system
- ✅ Real AI integration with fallback to mock for testing
- ✅ Full test coverage (unit, integration, quality tests)

## Sprint 2: CI/CD — Sprint 2 Update

### Pipeline Overview
Implemented a split CI/CD pipeline with four independent jobs for faster feedback and better parallelization.

### CI/CD Jobs
- **Build & Lint**: Install dependencies, lint code, type check, and build both Next.js app and API server
- **Unit Tests**: Run unit test suite with isolated test execution
- **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests with health check smoke test
- **Coverage Report**: Generate coverage reports with 80% threshold enforcement

### Evidence
- **Latest Green Actions Run**: [View in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/noahfor3/Ai-Study-Organizer/actions)
- **Coverage Percentage**: 80%+ (enforced by CI pipeline)
- **Vercel Preview URL**: Available on PR comments (auto-generated)
- **Production URL**: [Live after merge to main](https://ai-study-organizer.vercel.app)

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All four CI jobs pass (build, unit, integration, coverage)
- [ ] Vercel Preview link present on PR
- [ ] Production deploy successful on merge to main
- [ ] Branch protection rules enabled (see PR description)

### Next Steps
1. Enable branch protection on `main` branch
2. Require CI checks before merge
3. Monitor pipeline performance and optimize as needed
