# üß™ Test Case Development ‚Äî AI Study Schedule Generator

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the **test cases** developed for the *AI Study Schedule Generator*, a web-based system that generates a **personalized, hour-by-hour weekly study plan** based on real class schedules.

This feature uses the **Google Gemini API** to dynamically create optimized study routines for courses such as **CPSC 351**, **CPSC 491**, and **MATH 338** at CSUF.  
I initially experimented with *Pseudo AI* for schedule generation, but after finding its results inconsistent, I switched to the **Gemini API**, which provided far more accurate and structured responses.  
I successfully integrated Gemini using a free API key, verified on my **Google Cloud dashboard**, and connected it through our backend service.

## 3. Example: Successful Test Case (TC-01)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "CPSC 351": "Mon/Wed 1:15 PM - 2:30 PM",
  "CPSC 491": "Thu 7:00 PM - 9:45 PM",
  "MATH 338": "Mon 10:00 AM - 12:45 PM"
}










Actual Gemini API Output:


Here is a realistic, hour-by-hour weekly study schedule tailored to your classes, focusing on balancing workload, integrating breaks, and varying study methods.

This schedule assumes you start your day around 8:00 AM/9:00 AM and aim for a balance between academic rigor and personal well-being. Remember, this is a template; feel free to adjust times based on your energy levels and personal commitments.

**Tips for Success:**

1.  **Be Flexible:** Life happens. If you miss a session, don't panic. Use "Flex Time" or redistribute later in the week.
2.  **Stay Hydrated & Eat Well:** Your brain needs fuel!
3.  **Exercise Regularly:** Even short walks can significantly boost focus and reduce stress.
4.  **Get Enough Sleep:** Crucial for memory consolidation and alertness.
5.  **Utilize Office Hours:** Don't hesitate to ask professors or TAs for clarification.
6.  **Find a Study Buddy:** For CPSC and Math, explaining concepts to someone else is a powerful learning tool.
7.  **Minimize Distractions:** Use website blockers, put your phone away during study sessions.
