ðŸ§  AI Schedule Generator Testing Summary

After implementing the AI-powered study schedule generator, I tested multiple approaches to ensure stable functionality and accurate scheduling results.

Initially, I experimented with a Pseudo AI setup, but it lacked flexibility and accuracy. Therefore, I integrated Google Gemini AI using its free API key, which I was able to track through my Gemini Cloud dashboard for usage and quota monitoring.

Several test cases were conducted to confirm that the generator correctly produces structured schedules based on user input (such as subjects, duration, and deadlines). The screenshots below demonstrate the generated outputs, as well as how the AI successfully handled different time and subject inputs.

Tools Used:

Gemini API (Free Tier)

TypeScript / Next.js

VS Code for Development

GitHub for Collaboration and Version Control

Test Results Summary:

âœ… Schedule generation successful for multiple inputs

âœ… API authentication errors resolved

âœ… Consistent output format verified

âœ… Integration tested within the appâ€™s UI
